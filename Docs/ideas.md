# Jester World Ideas

(These would progress in difficulty and be more rewarding as you go.)

Jester Challenges:

 - Each Jester presents you with an encounter, like a riddle, word game, or puzzle.
 - And/or you must use your charisma to persuade the jester by selecting the correct dialog choices.

Skill Challenges:

 - Various types of challenges based on reflexes, timing and coordination.
 - Mini-games, quicktime events, platforming

World Challenges:

 - The world itself provides you with challenges like spatial or logic puzzles outside of an encounter, or just basic quests.
 - Given to you by a jester? They let you through to the next thing? (non-linearly)
 - Reward exploration with easter eggs that benefit you.
